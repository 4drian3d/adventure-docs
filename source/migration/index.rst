Migrating to Adventure from other APIs
======================================

Adventure integrates with many of the Minecraft platforms out there. Some platforms support
Adventure natively, but some platforms do not natively support Adventure. To enable you to use
Adventure with these platforms, Adventure provides a number of platform-specific adapters to
allow you to obtain ``Audience`` instances from native user types.
