Platforms
=========

Adventure integrates with many of the Minecraft platforms out there. Some platforms support
Adventure natively, but other platforms do not natively support Adventure. To enable you to use
Adventure with these platforms, Adventure provides a number of platform-specific adapters to
allow you to obtain ``Audience`` instances from native user types.

Native support
--------------

As of this writing, the under-development Velocity 1.1.0 and Sponge 8 support Adventure
natively. Sponge supports all Adventure functionality, Velocity supports sending messages,
action bars, boss bars, and titles only.
